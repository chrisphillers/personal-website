# Personal website

A really great way to stand out during the job hunting process is to have a personal website where hiring managers can learn a bit more about your skills and interests.

Throughout the course you will produce projects which will demonstrate the skills you have learned. By publishing your favourite projects on the web alongside the source code on Github you will be able to share your understanding and ability with potential hiring companies.

For this weekend project, create a personal website which should contain some interesting info about you, what you are working on and what you would like to do in future.

We would like to see clean and well structure HTML and CSS. Feel free to include any images you like.

Add links to any public social media accounts such as Twitter, LinkedIn or your blog. Avoid including Facebook or any other social media is overly personal.

Neat resources you can use to create a great looking website include

- [Coolors](http://coolors.co/) is a great palette generate website
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) has lots of great imagery you can use
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) provides plenty of free fonts you can use to enhance your website
